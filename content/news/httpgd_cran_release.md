My R package [httpgd](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd) is now released on CRAN.

This graphics device package allows to access R graphics with any browser (and for developers via a very simple HTTP/WebSocket API).

I started working on this about a year ago with the goal of creating an embedded plot viewer pane for R in Visual Studio Code.

It can now be installed via:

```R
install.packages("httpgd")
```
